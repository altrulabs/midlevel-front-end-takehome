# Minesweeper Take-home Exercise
Hello and welcome to Altru's take-home engineering assignment repo!

This project is intended to help us learn more about your skills, how you solve problems, and how you would fit on our team. The intention is for it to take 2-3 hours to complete. If it ends up taking more please let us know so we can focus your efforts on a more specific piece of the project. We recognize that you're probably juggling a lot of these and we want to be respectful of your time.

Now, with that out of the way, on to the good stuff!

## Instructions
Build a functioning Minesweeper clone. If you're not familiar with Minesweeper you can find copies of it all over the place. [Here's one without ads](http://birrell.org/andrew/minesweeper/expert.php) and there's a surprisingly robust [Wikipedia page] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minesweeper_(video_game)).

### Product Requirements:
- Your app must take in 3 arguments: Board width, Board height, Number of mines.
- Clicking on a square must reveal what's underneath, either a blank, a number between 1 and 8, or a mine.
- The user continues clicking until only mines or hidden or they click until they reveal a mine and they lose.

### Technical Requirements:
- You can use any frameworks, libraries, or technologies you choose.
- We recommend sticking with front end technologies but if you really think a PHP server will help, go for it.
- The finished product must run in the current version of Chrome.

### Recommendations:
- The aesthetic of the **app does not matter**! The interface doesn't have to be pretty, but the elements used to construct the app should be well organized and clearly defined.
- There are a lot of different solutions to this problem out there, we can't stop you from checking them (actually we encourage it), but don't copy code.
- This project can expand in a lot of directions, don't fall victim to feature-creep! We recommend building a baseline version of the app and then, time permitting, adding a flourish somewhere that highlights your skillset.
- Commit early and often, it's useful to see your progression. We follow the pattern [red-green-refactor](https://www.codecademy.com/articles/tdd-red-green-refactor) at work a lot, there's no shame showing your work while it's still in progress as long as you're proud of your finished product.

When you're done, please replace this README with a few sentences or bullets describing your thought process, things you would focus more on, or that we can improve regarding the assignment. The more communication the better!

If you have any questions please don't hesitate to email or call, can't wait to see what you come up with!
