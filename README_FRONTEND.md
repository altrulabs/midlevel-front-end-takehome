# Front-end Take-home Exercise
Hello and welcome to Altru's take home front-end engineering exercise!

This project is intended to help the Altru team learn more about your skills, how you solve problems, and how you would fit on our team. The intention is for it to take 2-3 hours to complete. If it ends up taking more please let us know so we can focus your efforts on a more specific piece of the project. We recognize that you're probably juggling a lot of these and we want to be respectful of your time.

Now, with that out of the way, on to the good stuff!

## Objective
Design and implement a prototype of the Altru video export modal.

Altru client administrators often wish to export videos from the Altru platform for distribution on other platforms like LinkedIn or Facebook. To do this they use Altru's video export tool, which is accessed in the video-detail modal of the admin application.

The purpose of this tool is to allow users to add customize images and text to a video before downloading it. Generally this is for branding purposes, but we've seen a wide variety of use cases.

The prototype you're building is just for the "Export Video" section of the video-detail modal, not for the whole modal or the whole page.

The objective is not to redefine the functionality of the product itself, but to take the existing functionality and present it in a more appealing, organized, intuitive way.

Since the Admin application isn't public facing, we're providing you this screen recording of the tool being used to help provide context: https://cdn.altrulabs.com/uploads/TheLab.mov

### Deliverables:
- When completed, this repo should contain a set of HTML, CSS, and JS files that render the prototype.
- You are free to focus on either aesthetics or interactions (UI vs UX), and can use JS or leave it out if you prefer.
- The content itself should consist entirely of placeholders, there are plenty of [text](http://officeipsum.com/) and [image](https://www.fillmurray.com/) generators to choose from.

### Requirements:
- The prototype should communicate clearly how users would place text and images on a video, reposition them, customize their size, shape, color, etc, and finally export the video.
- You can use any frameworks, libraries, or technologies you choose. We recommend sticking with front end technologies but if you really think a PHP server will help, go for it.
- The finished product must render in the current version of Chrome.

### Recommendations:
- Remember that this prototype doesnâ€™t have to actually do anything, it just has to communicate what the modal would look like if fully implemented.
- It is totally fine to focus entirely on either the aesthetic or the code, but definitely pick one and do the best you can on that front in the allotted time.
- Commit early and often, it's useful to see your progression. We follow the pattern [red-green-refactor](https://www.codecademy.com/articles/tdd-red-green-refactor) at work a lot, there's no shame showing your work while it's still in progress as long as you're proud of your finished product.

When you're done, please replace this README with a few sentences or bullets describing your thought process, things you would focus more on, or that we can improve regarding the assignment. The more communication the better!

If you have any questions please don't hesitate to email or call, can't wait to see what you come up with!
